### Slide 2: The 2-Year AI Revolution (2022-2024)
**Where We Started vs Where We Are**

**The Transformation Argument:**
The AI industry has undergone the fastest enterprise technology adoption in business history. To understand the entrepreneurial opportunity ahead, we must first examine the remarkable transformation that occurred in just 24 months.

**2022 Baseline:**
- **GPT-3 capabilities**: Limited to basic text generation with frequent errors and hallucinations
- **Enterprise adoption**: Only 50% of companies had any AI initiatives, mostly experimental
- **Integration complexity**: Required specialized teams and months of custom development
- **Market skepticism**: Many executives viewed AI as overhyped technology

**2024 Reality:**
- **Advanced multimodal AI**: GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini can process text, images, code, and audio simultaneously
- **Mainstream adoption**: 78% of enterprises now use AI in at least one business function
- **Accessible tools**: Enterprise AI assistants available through simple APIs and user interfaces
- **Proven ROI**: Companies reporting 50% efficiency gains in customer service, sales, and HR

**Evidence of Exponential Growth:**
According to McKinsey's longitudinal AI surveys¹, enterprise adoption increased from 50% to 78% in just 24 months - faster than internet adoption (took 7 years) or mobile technology (took 5 years). This follows Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation theory², showing AI has crossed from "Early Adopters" to "Early Majority" adoption phase.

**Entrepreneurial Implication:**
This rapid mainstream adoption creates immediate market demand for specialized AI implementation services, exactly the window entrepreneurs need to build sustainable businesses.
