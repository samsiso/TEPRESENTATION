# Workshop Improvement Plan: Incorporating Additional Feedback

## Overview
This document consolidates feedback from workshop moderators to help improve future presentations, particularly focusing on academic standards, engagement strategies, and professional delivery.

## Key Feedback Areas & Improvement Strategies

### 1. Learning Outcomes and Structure
**Feedback Highlights:**
- Aims were mentioned but not effectively phrased as Learning Outcomes (LOs)
- Should use Bloom's Taxonomy (from "Facilitating a Workshop" library session)
- Workshop didn't fully meet outcomes like "Help entrepreneurs position themselves competitively"
- Sequencing affected by unplanned Q&A, leading to overruns and lack of summaries/activities

**Strengths:**
- Logical agenda with topics outlined

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- Adopt Bloom's Taxonomy for clear, actionable LOs using specific verbs:
  - **Remembering:** "List key AI trends in entrepreneurship"
  - **Understanding:** "Explain how AI tools like predictive analytics apply to business growth"
  - **Applying:** "Demonstrate using an AI tool in a venture scenario"
  - **Analyzing:** "Compare AI's benefits and ethical risks in startups"
  - **Evaluating:** "Assess AI's impact on your team's competitiveness"
  - **Creating:** "Develop a personal action plan for AI integration"

- Use measurable verbs like "describe," "analyze," or "evaluate"
- State LOs verbally and on slides at start, revisit at end with summary
- Create detailed session plan with timed segments (e.g., 5 mins intro, 10 mins trends, 10 mins activity, 5 mins Q&A)

### 2. Sources, Data, and Credibility
**Feedback Highlights:**
- Good use of secondary data from websites, but unclear origins, generation methods, or purposes
- No primary data collected
- Missing academic research on AI (offers less bias via ethics reviews than company data)
- Validity of sources was key marking criterion not met

**Strengths:**
- Summary of trends showed real knowledge

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- For every data point, explicitly state: "This trend comes from [source], generated via [method], for [purpose]"
- Use UWE Harvard referencing: In-text (Author, Year); full refs at end
- Add primary data: Pre-workshop survey of team via Google Forms (5 questions, 10+ responses)
- Incorporate academic perspectives for balance:
  - 2025 reviews on AI technologies in entrepreneurial practice
  - Research on AI's impact on entrepreneurship (opportunities vs. risks)
  - Studies on AI and creativity in entrepreneurship education
  - IZA papers defining AI's entrepreneurial applications
- Aim for 8+ sources: Mix 4 academic (Google Scholar) + 4 professional (industry reports)

### 3. Delivery, Communication, and Professionalism
**Feedback Highlights:**
- Excessive swearing throughout presentation
- Body language mixed: enthusiastic but distracting (pen clicking, running for drink)
- Good communicator with confident voice/pace and strong Q&A responses
- Lacked professionalism (casual jargon, hood)

**Strengths:**
- Enthusiasm maintained engagement
- Adapted well to questions, open to perspectives

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- Professionalize language: Avoid swearing/jargon (say "outperform experts" instead of "smoke")
- Practice neutral, inclusive phrasing
- Body language: Record yourself, eliminate fidgets, keep hands visible but purposeful
- Dress as if pitching investors: business casual, no hood
- Monitor time actively: "We have 2 mins left for this section"
- Check understanding: "Quick show of hands—who's tried AI tools?"

### 4. Audience Participation, Engagement, and Accessibility
**Feedback Highlights:**
- Participation mainly from unplanned audience questions (uneven, not everyone involved)
- Disrupted timings, no attempted dialogue for exploration
- Lack of activities affected sequencing and full engagement
- Not explicit on accessibility support

**Strengths:**
- Questions answered effectively
- Some rapport built with audience

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- Plan interactivity: Facilitate dialogue instead of passive Q&A
  - "What AI challenges have you faced? [Pause] Person A, build on that—anyone agree/disagree?"
- Add structured activities:
  - 5-min pair discussions: "Discuss how AI could apply to your venture"
  - Live polls via Mentimeter
  - End with summaries: "Key takeaway: AI boosts competitiveness but needs ethical checks"
- Accessibility considerations:
  - Ask at start: "Any needs (e.g., captions, large text)?"
  - Provide materials early
  - Ensure high-contrast slides
  - Verbally confirm: "Is this accessible for everyone?"

### 5. Overall Preparation and Next Steps
**Feedback Highlights:**
- Seemed unprepared at times (unclear on slides/context)
- Clear topic knowledge but didn't meet criteria for sources/primary data/activities
- More preparation would improve engagement and professionalism

**Strengths:**
- Demonstrated expertise through trends discussion and Q&A

**Holistic Action Plan:**
1. Rehearse fully with timed mock audience
2. Attend "Facilitating a Workshop" session for Bloom's Taxonomy guidance
3. Track AI updates via reports (McKinsey 2025 AI workplace insights: 78% business adoption)
4. Revise slides with proper LOs, sources, and activities
5. Target 60%+ score next time by hitting "Good" criteria across all assessment areas

## Key Academic Sources to Incorporate
- Stanford AI Index 2025 (industry trends)
- Recent entrepreneurship + AI research papers
- McKinsey AI workplace reports
- PwC AI predictions
- IZA economic papers on AI applications

## Success Metrics for Next Workshop
- Clear, measurable learning outcomes using Bloom's Taxonomy
- 8+ credible sources (mix academic/professional)
- Primary data from team survey
- Structured activities with time management
- Professional delivery without swearing/distracting behavior
- Inclusive engagement strategies
- Accessibility considerations addressed
