# Slide 14 Script: Market Growth Trajectory & Projections (1 minute)

## Scenario Modeling Introduction (15 seconds)
**[Point to growth trajectory chart]** NewStrail Research provides three scenario models for AI market growth from $27 billion today to potentially $500 billion by 2032. **[Trace the three lines]** These scenarios help us plan for different market conditions and validate our strategic timing.

## Growth Rate Analysis (25 seconds)
**[Point to conservative line]** The conservative scenario assumes 28% CAGR reaching $196 billion, accounting for regulatory delays and slower adoption. **[Point to base case line]** Our base case projects 36.6% CAGR reaching $330 billion following current trends. **[Point to optimistic line]** The optimistic scenario shows 45% CAGR reaching $530 billion with breakthrough innovations accelerating adoption.

## Strategic Planning Implications (20 seconds)
**[Gesture to all scenarios]** Even the conservative 28% CAGR delivers substantial opportunity - an 18.5x growth multiple over eight years. **[Point to highlight box]** This validates our strategy regardless of scenario outcome. **[Tap timing indicators]** The analysis confirms entering during 2025-2028 high-growth phase maximizes opportunity capture before market maturation.
