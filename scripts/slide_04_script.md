# Slide 4 Script: Current State of AI Adoption (1 minute)

## Market Reality Introduction (15 seconds)

## Adoption Gap Analysis (25 seconds)
**[Point to the chart showing adoption by company size]**

**[Reference industry breakdown]**
"Even within sectors, we see massive variation - 95% in tech but only 49% in retail. This fragmentation is our opportunity."

## Strategic Implication (15 seconds)
