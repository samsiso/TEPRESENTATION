# Slide 11 Script: Bass Diffusion Model Application (1 minute)

## Mathematical Model Introduction (15 seconds)
**[Point to Bass model chart]** The Bass Diffusion Model from 1969 provides quantitative validation of our market timing strategy. **[Point to curve]** With an R-squared of 0.94, this mathematical model excellently fits AI adoption patterns and predicts future growth.

## Model Parameters Analysis (25 seconds)
**[Point to innovation coefficient]** The innovation coefficient of 0.003 represents external influence like marketing and media. **[Point to imitation coefficient]** The imitation coefficient of 0.028 shows word-of-mouth effect is nine times stronger. **[Point to peak year]** This predicts peak adoption rate in 2027-2028 - confirming our 24-month strategic window is optimal timing.

## Strategic Validation (20 seconds)
**[Gesture to growth phases]** The model shows we're entering the peak growth phase where adoption rate maximizes. **[Point to highlight box]** This quantitative analysis validates our market entry strategy - we must establish position before 2027 peak to capture maximum growth opportunity during the steepest part of the adoption curve.

## Key Speaking Points:
- Bass Diffusion Model provides mathematical validation with 94% accuracy
- Word-of-mouth influence (0.028) is 9x stronger than marketing influence (0.003)
- Peak adoption rate predicted for 2027-2028 confirming our strategic window
- Quantitative proof supports entering market before peak for maximum growth capture
