# Slide 6 Script: Rogers' Diffusion Theory Explained (1 minute)

## Theory Introduction (20 seconds)
"Now let's dive into the academic foundation of our analysis - Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation Theory from 2003, which has become the gold standard for understanding technology adoption."

## S-Curve Explanation (25 seconds)
**[Point to the S-curve chart]**
"Rogers identified five adopter categories along this S-curve. We start with 2.5% innovators - the risk-takers who experiment first. Then 13.5% early adopters - the opinion leaders who validate new tech."

**[Trace the curve upward]**
"The magic happens at 16% total adoption - that's when we cross the chasm into mass market. The early majority - 34% of the market - represents mainstream adoption."

## Current Position Analysis (10 seconds)
**[Point to current position]**
"At 78% enterprise adoption, we're clearly in the early majority phase - past the risky experimentation but before market saturation."

## Strategic Application (5 seconds)
"This isn't just theory - it's a roadmap for timing our market entry perfectly."
