## Actionable Steps to Redo Workshop

### Step 1: Refine Topic & Rationale (1-2 hours)

### Step 2: Conduct Primary Research (1 hour)

- **0-5 mins**: Intro (LOs, agenda, accessibility needs)
- **5-20 mins**: Trends presentation (slides with visuals, poll)
- **20-30 mins**: Interactive activity (pairs work with ChatGPT)
- **30-45 mins**: Facilitated dialogue/Q&A with evaluation

#### Materials
- 8-10 slides (visual, not text-heavy)
- Kahoot for ethics quiz
- Handout: Trend summary PDF (accessible format)
- High-contrast, large fonts, alt-text on images

### Step 6: Prepare Delivery & Professionalism (1-2 hours practice)
- Record via Panopto

- Facilitate rather than present
- Strict time management
- Interactive dialogue techniques

### Step 7: Future Action Plan
- **Past Application**: "Applied innovation theory in venture for 25% efficiency"
