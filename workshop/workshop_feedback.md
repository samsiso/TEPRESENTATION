## Workshop Content (50% of Total - ~39% average)

### Knowledge and Understanding (25%) - 38% Poor
**Feedback Highlights:**
- Sources cited inconsistently (no full reference list, no Harvard style)
- Mainly professional sources (potentially biased) rather than academic ones
- No primary research
- Some critical thinking on trends, but missing contrasting perspectives
- Missing ethical data evaluation

**Strengths:**
- Good summary of current AI trends
- Some interpretation of data

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- **Sourcing**: Aim for at least 8 credible sources, mixing academic and professional
- Use UWE Harvard style fullyâ€”include in-text citations and complete reference list
- **Primary Research**: Include your own data (surveys, interviews with entrepreneurs)
- **Critical Thinking**: Add sections comparing perspectives and discussing ethics
- **Next Steps**: Search academic AI sources via Google Scholar

### Application of Theories/Frameworks (25%) - 40% Poor
**Feedback Highlights:**
- Some rationale for topic choice linked to experience and goals
- Vague on team needs
- Illustrated past application but no specific future action plan

**Strengths:**
- Links to career and personal experience

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- **Rationale**: Explicitly tie topic to team needs
- **Action Plan**: Create detailed implementation section with SMART goals
- Include specific past examples with frameworks used and outcomes
- **Next Steps**: Use frameworks like diffusion of innovations for action planning

- Delivery was mostly one-way

**Strengths:**
- Good initial engagement question
- Visuals supported explanations

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- **Materials**: Simplify slides (5-7 lines max per slide, more images)

- Clear agenda and purpose, logical sequence
- Good responses to questions with openness to perspectives
- Monitored time somewhat but overran in Q&A

- Distracting habits (pen clicking, casual language/swearing, hood)
- Learning outcomes not aligned to Bloom's Taxonomy

**Strengths:**
- Enthusiasm, clear voice/pace
- Strong Q&A handling
- Rapport-building

**Improvement Recommendations:**
- **Facilitation**: Align outcomes to Bloom's Taxonomy levels
- **Communication Skills**: Professionalize language, avoid swearing/jargon
- **Management**: Balance vocal participants, evaluate understanding mid-way
- **Next Steps**: Review Bloom's Taxonomy, record practice sessions for self-assessment
